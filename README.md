# Training_data_preperation
All handy scripts related to training data preperation and labeling. Deciption of functions:
- [Split image detection](#Split-image-detection)
- [Compare textfiles](#Compare-textfiles)
- [Remove objects label](#Remove-objects-label)
- [Copy images based](#Copy-images-based)

| name | short description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Split image detection | split panorama images and detections to smaller parts |
| Compare textfiles | check two detctions to identify changes in labeling  | 
| Remove objects label | remove extra lables you dont need any more  |
| Copy images based | Copy the images that have detection texts from one dir to another |

#### Split image detection
The purpose of this script is to split images and already detected boxes into smaller pieces ready for training with yolo
```More description:
Get the images and detection texts and divide images to smaller parts
input image : Trimble MX9 Panorama 8000*400 ->image_A.jpg
output images : 4 images in 2000*2000 ->image_A_1.jpg,image_A_2.jpg, image_A_3.jpg, image_A_4.jpg
                im1 = im[1100:3100, 0:2000]
                im2 = im[1100:3100, 2000:4000]
                im3 = im[1100:3100, 4000:6000]
                im4 = im[1100:3100, 6000:8000]
input_texts : detection in the original image dimensions
output_texts :  detections on new image formats
```
#### Compare textfiles
check if two detction texts are the same or not in case of changed file, it copies both text and image to output folder
```More description:
Get the detection texts paths (edited and original ones) and compare the content
input : edited and original texts dir paths, splitted image dir paths
output : text ones that are changed (means the model labeling was not ok) and its related images from seperated image dir
```
#### Remove objects label
remove extra lables you dont need any more for the training from detection texts
```More description:
Get the detection texts and remove labels you dont want to be present anymore there
input : Texts with full labels
output : Texts with just arbitrary labels rearranged from 0
```
#### Copy images based
Name of script: copy_images_based_on_availbale_detections.py
Copy the images that have detection texts from one dir to another
```More description: 
    input : images and detections paths, output path for images
    output : None
```
